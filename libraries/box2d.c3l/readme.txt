This library code follows the same licence as the rest of the vendor libraries, if any.
 
My main language is not English, so expect grammer erros in code comments...
I'm also not a expert on C3 language, this is my first vendor library in c3, I did it at first for my own use but I think it can benefite the community, 
 , some things maybe wrong or can be done better, be free to solve any issues if you encounter them.
Sorry for those using later 0.7.0 C3 syntax but this library is written using C3 0.6.8, because that is what I'm using myself, anyone can update to later syntax if desired.
